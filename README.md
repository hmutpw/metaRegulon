# metaRegulon: An integrated computational framework for single-cell transcription factor activity analysis

[The metaRegulon framework](Figure_1.png)
The metaRegulon aims to provide a comprehensive platform for transcription factor activity analysis. We continue to update the platform and add new features to this platform. 

1. For the usage of this packages, please refer to the **metaRegulon** [vignette](https://hmutpw.github.io/metaRegulon/).
2. For gene regulatory network (GRN) inference, please refer to the **PUIC** [vignette](https://hmutpw.github.io/PUIC/).
3. For step-by-step analysising of TF activities, please refer to the **scATFR** [vignette](https://hmutpw.github.io/scATFR/).

#### To introduce the application of TF activities in single-cell assays, we introduce some of the cases:

Case study I: [Cell-type specificity analysis during HSC development in mouse embryos](https://hmutpw.github.io/metaRegulon/Case1.html)

Case study II: [Decoding the dynamic TF activity during HSC formation](https://hmutpw.github.io/metaRegulon/Case2.html)
